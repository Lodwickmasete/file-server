# Simple File Browser with Flask

This repository contains a basic file browser implemented using Flask, a Python web framework. It allows you to navigate through a directory structure on your server and download files directly from your browser.

## Features

-   **Directory Listing:** Displays the contents of directories, showing both files and subdirectories.
-   **Navigation:** Allows navigation through the directory structure using breadcrumbs.
-   **File Download:** Enables downloading of files directly through the browser.
-   **Empty Directory Handling:** Shows a user-friendly message when a directory is empty.
-   **404 Error Handling:** Gracefully handles cases where a file or directory is not found.
-   **Cache Busting:** Appends a timestamp to file URLs to force browser refresh and prevent caching issues.
